    <abstract>

      <t>An ongoing change plans to replace the current IETF
      Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) with a board for a
      newly created administrative organisation. This change will have
      an impact in the IETF Trust as well, primarily because members
      of the IAOC have also served as trustees of the IETF Trust. This
      memo describes the dependencies between the Trust and the IETF
      administrative framework, and suggests changes to allow the IETF
      Trust to continue its service to the IETF and others, with
      minimal impact to those services.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>The arrangements relating to administrative support for the
      IETF (referred to as the "IETF Administrative Support Activity"
      (IASA) <xref target="RFC4071"/>) are being changed.</t>

      <t>One of the planned changes is to remove the IETF
      Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) and replace it with a
      board that oversees a new, formal organisation whose boundaries
      towards Internet Society (ISOC) and elsewhere are clearly
      defined.</t>
      
      <t>However, the IAOC is interwtined with another IETF
      organisation, the IETF Trust (<xref target="RFC4371"/>), and as
      a result, changes to IAOC will also impact the IETF Trust.</t>
      
      <t>This memo describes the dependencies between the Trust and
      the IETF administrative framework, and suggests changes to allow
      the IETF Trust to continue its service to the IETF and others,
      with minimal impact to those services.</t>

      <t>The rest of this document is organised as follows. <xref
      target="background"/> describes briefly what the IETF Trust is
      and how the current organisation is arranged. <xref
      target="dependencies"/> points out the dependencies between IETF
      Trust and the rest of IASA, and how those dependencies require
      action in the context of IASA 2.0 project. <xref
      target="approach"/> discusses the general approach to these
      changes, i.e., minimal changes and keeping the IETF Trust as its
      own standalone entity. <xref target="changes"/> describes the
      specific changes that are needed, along with potential
      alternatives where they exist. Finally, <xref
      target="transition"/> discusses what needs to be done before
      these, final changes take effect.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="background" title="Background">
      
      <t>The purpose of the IETF Trust is to acquire, hold, maintain,
      and license certain existing and future intellectual property
      and other property used in connection with the administration of
      the IETF <xref target="RFC4371"/>. The intellectual property is,
      for instance, rights that the IETF contributors grant for text
      in RFCs and Internet Drafts. The IETF Trust also manages
      trademarks and domains such as "IETF" and ietf.org. The IETF
      Trust is also serving the broader Internet community by holding
      domains and trademark associated with IANA <xref
      target="RFC7979"/>.</t>
      
      <t>The IETF Trust is a legal entity, registered in the
      Commonwealth of Virginia <xref target="Trust-FD"/>. The budget
      for IETF Trust <xref target="Trust-Budget"/> is covered from the
      Internet Society and a few other sources. The main expenses
      relate to legal assistance and domain name and trademark
      registrations.</t>
      
      <t>Currently, the members of the IAOC are also serving as
      trustees of the IETF Trust. The founding documents specify
      persons eligible to become trustees as having to be then-current
      members of the IAOC <xref target="Trust-FD"/>.  The documents
      also specify that if for any reason there are fewer than three
      individuals serving as trustees, then the IESG, or the IESG's
      successor as the leadership of the IETF, shall appoint one or
      more individuals to serve in a temporary capacity as Trustee(s)
      until eligible persons can be found.</t>
      
      <t>In the current system there are eight IAOC members. They are
      named by the IETF Nominations Committee or NomCom (two members),
      IESG (one member), IAB (one member), Internet Society Board of
      Trustees (one member), along with three ex-officio members via
      their roles as IETF Chair, Internet Society CEO, or IAB
      Chair.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="dependencies" title="Dependencies">
      
      <t>The following dependencies exist:
      <list style="hanging">
	
	<t hangText="Trustees"><vspace blankLines="1"/> The IETF Trust
	depends on having IAOC members as Trustees. A new arrangement
	for this needs to be found.</t>
	
	<t hangText="IPR Usage"><vspace blankLines="1"/> The IETF
	Trust needs to allow organisations to use the trademarks and
	other assets its owns. As a new legal entity is created for
	IETF administration, it becomes necessary to authorize
	this new entity to use the assets that it needs.</t>
	
      </list></t>
      
      <t>In addition, for the part of IETF Trust funding coming
      directly from Internet Society today, that arrangement could
      either stay or be changed in some manner.</t>
      
    </section>
      
    <section anchor="approach" title="General Approach">
      
      <t>There are two basic approaches to resolving the
      dependencies. One could imagine merging all IETF Trust functions
      in the new IASA structure and under the planned new legal
      entity. This memo advocates a second approach where the IETF
      Trust is kept independent, but its dependencies on, for instance,
      IAOC members are resolved through other means.</t>
      
      <t>The rationale for advocating the second approach is in part
      to avoid causing too much change for the IETF Trust at a time
      when the IETF administrative structure is ongoing major change.
      And, perhaps more importantly, the IETF Trust and other
      administrative IETF process are quite different. While very
      important, the IETF Trust is a very low activity entity where
      changes, if any, are minimal and gradual. There are no pressing
      issues, and the organisation serves the broader Internet
      community than perhaps the day-to-day and more IETF
      meetings-focused other parts of IASA.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="changes" title="Specific Changes to IETF Trust">
      
      <t>This memo also suggestes that the new IETF administrative entity
      be given rights to use the IETF domain names and trademarks,
      which seems reasonable given that the administrative entity is the
      one that administers the IETF web site anyway.</t>

      <t>Secondly, if we want to keep the IETF Trust separate as
      discussed in <xref target="approach"/>, there needs to be a new
      way to name trustees. At the time the trustees served both the
      IETF Trust and the IAOC, many of the requirements for naming a
      particular group of people were driven by the IAOC's requirements.
      For the IETF Trust in the new model, some of those arrangements
      can be rethought, both in terms of the number and source of
      the trustees, as well as the desired qualifications and length of
      terms.</t>

      <t>Several options are possible, of course. A newly designed
      naming process could be devised. This memo argues for relatively
      limited change, however, largely on the basis of the IETF Trust
      arrangements generally working well, and on the relatively modest
      expected time commitments combined with the need for very careful
      management of the assets.</t>
      
      <t>As a result, this memo suggests that a smaller group of five
      trustees is sufficient, with three named by the Nomcom, one
      named by the IESG, and one named by the Internet Society Board
      of Trustees.</t>
      
      <t>In addition, the terms for the Nomcom- and IESG-named
      trustees should be set to three years.
      
      <list style="empty">

	<t>Note: It does not seem necessary for the IAB Chair or the
	Internet Society CEO to be members of the IETF
	Trust. Similarly, the IESG can choose the person they want to
	oversee the IETF Trust, and it is not necessary that this
	person be the IETF Chair. In general, the tasks of the IETF
	Trust are well defined, and while there is a need for
	coordination, it does not need to be at the level of chairs or
	CEOs.</t>
	
      </list></t>
      
      <t>The normal IETF rules regarding recalls and other Nomcom-related
      processes continue to apply <xref target="RFC7437"/>.</t>

      <t>The next section discusses what document changes are needed
      to make these changes.</t>
      
      <t>Finally, this memo suggests that funding arrangements for the
      IETF Trust stay as they are, but for the part of IETF Trust
      funding that comes from Internet Society today be managed via
      the new administrative entity instead.

      <list style="empty">
	<t>An alternative approach would be to make no changes.</t>
      </list></t>
      
      <section title="Required Documentation Changes">

	<t>This document, if approved, will revise the current
	procedures defined in <xref target="RFC4071"/> and <xref
	target="RFC4371"/>.</t>
	
	<t>In addition, the Trust Founding Documents need to be
	revised to specify how trustees can become eligible in the new
	arrangement. Such a revision belongs to the IETF Trust, with
	community review before making a change.</t>
	
	<t>The rights of the new IETF administrative entity with
	regards to IETF Trust copyright, trademarks, and domain names
	need to be formally acknowledged. This also an action that
	belongs to the IETF Trust.</t>
	
      </section>
      
    </section>

    <section anchor="transition" title="Transition">

      <t>The new entity for IETF administration is being set up, and
      at some point, the IAOC will also be discontinued. Fortunately,
      there's no pressing need to change all the components at the
      same time. As discussed above (<xref target="background"/>), the
      IESG holds the ability to continue to name trustees. Once the
      changes suggested in <xref target="changes"/> are in place, the
      IETF Trust will have management nominated in the usual manner,
      and the exceptional IESG process is no longer needed.</t>

      <t>However, the following actions do need to take place
      when a new administrative entity is created:
      <list style="symbols">
	
	<t>Any changes to how current Internet Society funding for
	IETF Trust need to be agreed. Perhaps this agreement can be
	a part of the operating agreement that is being drafted. And
	as discussed above, it seems logical that the IETF Trust
	funding will be arranged through the new administrative
	entity.</t>
	
	<t>The new administrative entity needs to be given rights to
	use the IETF domain names and trademarks. This is normal IETF
	Trust business and can be handled in the usual manner.</t>
	
      </list></t>
